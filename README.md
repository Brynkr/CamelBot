Here's the source code for any who are interested. Feel free to PM with queries on Discord @Cat_Smoker.

NB: 'Constants.py' has been removed from the commit as it contains sensitive information. You'll have to go through and manually replace all Constants.<X> with your own stuff if you want to run an instance of this bot.

You can find a Constants.py file with all the sensitive info removed here: https://pastebin.com/3b4xNuna
