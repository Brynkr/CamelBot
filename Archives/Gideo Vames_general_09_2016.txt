[05/09/2016-18:57:59] blu3max: fun fact because I got curious. Its called a American Fotoplayer, built between 1912-1925 for more "immersive moving pictures"
[05/09/2016-18:58:18] Cat_Smoker: haha awesome
[05/09/2016-18:58:27] Cat_Smoker: it was used in like the mickey mouse movies and stuff right?

[15/09/2016-20:50:46] Trumpefmeister: This work led to an interesting discovery. When an engine was optimized specifically for high speed, it burned perhaps twice as much fuel at that speed than when it was running at subsonic speeds. However, the aircraft would be flying as much as four times as fast. Thus its most economical cruise speed, in terms of fuel per mile, was its maximum speed. This was entirely unexpected and implied that there was no point in the dash concept; if the aircraft was able to reach Mach 3, it may as well fly its entire mission at that speed. The question remained whether such a concept was technically feasible, but by March 1957, engine development and wind tunnel testing had progressed enough to suggest it was.
